.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbreakit\fR assists the user in submitting Slurm job array of important
size on shaheen II. It has been designed, developped and officially
maintained by the Kaust Supercomputing Laboratory.
.PP
By policy, on shaheen II, the maximum number of jobs authorized in the
queue is limited per user. \fBbreakit\fR seamlessly allows the submission of
job arrays whose total number can be higher than this limit. 
.
.
.SH USE
.PP
Not a single modification needs to be made to the Slurm job it self.
Let assume 1000 occcurences of "\fImy_job\fR" needs to be submitted, the
command:
.PP
.BI "   breakit \-\-job=\fImy-job\fR \-\-array=\fI1-1000\fR \-\-chunk=\fI20\fR"
.PP
will submit the 1000 jobs to shaheen II in several chunks of 20
jobs. At a time, no more than 20 jobs will appear in the queue. In
reality, \fBbreakit\fR will use job dependency to automate the ongoing
submission of the remaining jobs. These batches of 20 jobs will be
seen as successive job arrays in the scheduling queue.
.PP
The \fB--array\fR option accept the same type of input as the sbatch command.
.PP
If no option \fB--chunk\fR is mentionned, default number of jobs queued simultaneously is set to 8.
.PP
The option \fB--kill\fR kills all the jobs of the current study.
.PP
The option \fB--status\fR gives a detailed status of the jobs
currently running, pending, waiting to be submitted or finished
weither completed or returned with failure.
.PP
The option \fB--scratch\fR kills all the running or waiting jobs and
allows the user to restart a new study from scratch in the same
directory. An already existing and even currently running study can
also be partially restarted, resumed or extended using
\fB--restart\fR.
